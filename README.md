# UtterNnSense
Spinoff of the game Utter non-sense as a multi-user online game. 

Typical Utter Non-Sense game:
All players have to use the same accent/voice card that's drawn, but you get to
choose which of your phrase cards you use! You just want the judge to pick yours as the best!
Includes 50 accent/voice cards and 450 phrases.


How this Utter Non-Sense game will work:
--> Users will enter names onto home screen and once on the website this will log them into the datbase; 
--> User will have two options player or judge per game [This is diffrent from the normal Utter Nonsense game where
the judge will typically change per round this is done to simplify the functionality of the game;] 
--> Users will decide among themselves which player will start off as the judge;
--> Database must be 5 players or greater and 10 players or less;
--> Game will start players will get two phrase cards randomly allocated per user name;
--> Random accent card will generate only when judge initiates it;
--> Judge will be allowed to tally all the users who won each round;
--> At the end of the game winners name will appear on the screen!;

Whew! That's all folks :)
